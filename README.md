 Learning Server Side JavaScript

This repository contains my journey through learning Node.js fundamentals, package files, file system and HTTP modules, and streams. Each day, I will tackle different topics and exercises to deepen my understanding of Node.js.

## Day 1: Introduction to Node.js Fundamentals
- Learnt what Node.js is and why it's used.
- Set up a Node.js environment.
- Wrote a "Hello!" script in a greet function.
- When working with file system i realized that whenever i would run my code i would always encounter the "MODULE NOT FOUND" error to fix this i had to: 
    1. check if the fs module was installed (npm list fs)
    2. npm install fs
    3. verify

All this fixed part of the error i wsa having however i learnt about cd to locate the files or project directory and as well as creating a JSON file.
