# Given a scenario and requirements infer which Node.js CLI command is a good solution.

# Node.js CLI and NPM Commands

During this learning journey, I have gained valuable insights into the various command-line interface (CLI) options and npm commands available in Node.js. I have successfully identified and demonstrated the following key aspects:

1. **Identifying the main uses cases of Node.js CLI commands**: I have learned about the various CLI options available in Node.js, including runtime options, debugging commands, and ways to execute scripts.

2. **Executing a Node.js application using the CLI**: I have gained hands-on experience in running Node.js applications using the `node` command and its parameters.

3. **Entering the REPL mode for executing JavaScript code**: I have explored the Read Evaluate Print Loop (REPL) feature, which allows me to interactively execute JavaScript code via the command line.

4. **Identifying important npm commands and additional CLI options**: I have familiarized myself with some of the most important npm commands, such as `npm install`, `npm uninstall`, and `npm run`, as well as additional CLI options that can be used to customize the behavior of these commands.

5. **Debugging a Node.js application**: I have learned how to use the `node inspect` command to launch the debugger and debug JavaScript code in a Node.js application.

By completing this learning scenario, I have strengthened my understanding of Node.js and its ecosystem, and I am now better equipped to tackle real-world development challenges.
