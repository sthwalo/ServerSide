/**
 * A developer at a software company is building a Node.js application for which she requires certain libraries. Some libraries such as lodash and express are required for running the application. On the other hand, there are libraries like jest and webpack which are required for the purposes of development only. She needs to install these libraries while making sure that only the libraries that are required for running the application can be easily installed in the production later.
 * Furthermore, once lodash is installed she would like to quickly evaluate the following JS code using the CL to check if the library could be used to meet specific requirement.
